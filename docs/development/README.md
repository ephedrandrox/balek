# Balek Development
 > There are two main folders meant to be the development entry points 
 * [`builds/`](../../builds/README.md)
 * [`src/balek-modules/`](../../src/balek-modules/README.md)

There are several [Base Primitives](../../src/balek-modules/base/README.md)  that can be extended when building [Modules](./modules.md)

These modules can then be  [built](../builds/README.md) into deployable containers
