# Balek Modules

> Modules are packages of code managed by Balek and loaded by [sessions](sessions.md).  

Modules are intended to: 
 * be portable packages 
 * be easily built, transfered, and loaded
 * utilize Balek for full stack services
 * be maintainable as individual projects
  
 > Checkout the [Module Development Guide](development/modules.md) if you are interested in developing your own modules.
